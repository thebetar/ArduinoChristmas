# What is this project

I have been fond of playing around with arduino's for a while now and I wanted to create a project where I can combine my love for christmas with my love for arduino's.

For this project you will need
- Arduino Uno
- One button
- Two lights (preferably red and green)
- Two buzzers
- Male to male cables
- Breadboard
- Christmas tree with lights on 5V

And that's it!

I have used the ToneLibrary from Brett Hagman to allow sound to be played on multiple buzzers for the harmonious effect.
Take a look and try it yourself!
